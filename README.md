SQL Skills Refresher â€“ Practicing with MySQL Workbench
To reinforce my SQL fundamentals, I recently completed a hands-on project using MySQL Workbench. Working with a self-created external data source, I designed relational tables and performed a wide range of queries to create, manipulate, and analyze structured datasets.

Key Highlights: 
Created and structured clean, comma-separated data
Practiced essential SQL operations including CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, DROP, and CASE statements
Explored views, joins, nested queries, grouping, and aggregation
Prepared datasets suitable for visualization in Power BI, Tableau, or Python

Why MySQL?
Open-source and widely supported
Scalable for large datasets
Reliable and easy to use
Seamlessly integrates with modern development tools and analytics platforms

Throughout the project, I primarily worked with DDL and DML commands, while also revisiting DCL, TCL, and DQL concepts. This project served as a great refresher and foundation to move toward more complex SQL workflows and real-world data applications.

Excited to continue expanding my data skills and applying them to increasingly complex business scenarios.
